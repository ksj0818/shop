          Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for
          users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies. While the
          styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these
          users will simply be presented with the content of the badge.
          Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random
          additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.
          Unless the context is clear, consider including additional context
          with a visually hidden piece of additional text.
